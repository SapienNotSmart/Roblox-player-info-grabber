# Roblox-player-info-grabber
this script gets info about the player that executed the script and send the info into a discord webhook, still having some bugs but i think it can help some people

# for education purposes only
remember, exploiting in roblox is bad, so stop exploiting and go touch grass for a bit
Anyway, use it how you want, just don't be a bad person.

im so lazy to make this repo beautiful, so this is all you need know, you can also make changes in the script to get other info too idk, enjoy it
